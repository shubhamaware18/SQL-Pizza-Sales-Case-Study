![Pizza Sales Anlysis(EDA)](https://github.com/shubhamaware18/SQL-Pizza-Sales-Case-Study/blob/main/artifacts/image.png)
## Overview

This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries. The dataset includes information about orders, pizza types, sizes, prices, and timestamps. By querying this data, we can derive insights into customer preferences, revenue generation, and sales trends.

## Basic Queries

1. **Total Number of Orders**: Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. **Total Revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. **Highest-Priced Pizza**: Identify the pizza with the highest price.
4. **Most Common Pizza Size**: Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. **Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types**: List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

## Intermediate Queries

1. **Total Quantity by Pizza Category**: Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
2. **Orders Distribution by Hour**: Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
3. **Category-Wise Pizza Distribution**: Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4. **Average Pizzas Ordered per Day**: Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5. **Top 3 Pizza Types by Revenue**: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

## Advanced Queries

1. **Percentage Contribution to Total Revenue**: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
2. **Cumulative Revenue Over Time**: Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
3. **Top 3 Pizza Types by Revenue for Each Category**: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.


## Files Included

- **SQL Queries**: Contains SQL queries for basic, intermediate, and advanced analyses.
- **Data Model**: Schema of the database tables used for the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project and its contents.
